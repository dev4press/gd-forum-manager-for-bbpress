                <h3>Improved Customization</h3>
                <p>
                    Customizer support has been significantly updated, and now you can not only select one of predefined color/style schemes, you can build one by selecting one of the 3 themes available, modifying one of the base colors, typography or additional colors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additional colors are all disabled by default, but, you can enable colour override and you can adjust the colour you need. Typography includes only font size and line height, and the font is inherited from whatever the theme uses.
