                <h3>Edit individual topics and forums</h3>
                <p>
                    With this plugin you can edit some topic or forum values directly from the topics or forums lists, without the need to open individual topic or forum, and then opening edit screen, or going through the admin side to do that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Plugin registers various values as editable, and right now that includes: topic or forum title, forum status and visibility, topic status, sticky status and parent forum.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On single topic pages plugin adds 'Quick Edit' action that works for that one topic.

                <h3>Bulk editing for topics and forums</h3>
                <p>
                    And, if you want to edit multiple forums or topics at once, you can do that with the use of bulk editing - simply select one or more forum or topic from any list showing them, and bulk edit panel will be available.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bulk editor popup panel is similar to Edit, but, titles can't be changed, and all other fields have "Don't Change" value, allowing you to change only some of the included values.

                <h3>Developer Friendly</h3>
                <p>
                    Plugin can be expanded to include more actions for both topics and forums, for edit or bulk edit. Dev4Press own GD Topic Prefix Pro plugin is the first one to include support for GD Forum Manager by adding Prefix edit action, and more plugins will follow.

                <h3>Lightweight and AJAX powered</h3>
                <p>
                    Plugin works through AJAX (popup display and saving), and it adds very little overhead to pages, and it does so only for users with keymaster or moderator roles, it doesn't load for any other user roles. It is very easy and simple to setup, with only few options available.
